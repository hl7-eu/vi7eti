                              <p>Flucelvax Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Flucelvax Tetra is prepared
                                 in cell cultures, and, therefore, is egg-free.</p>
                              <p>When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence
                                 system) will produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients
                                 in the vaccine can cause flu.</p>
                              <p>Flucelvax Tetra is used to prevent flu in adults and children from 2 years of age.</p>
                              <p>The vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations
                                 by the World Health Organisation for the 2022/2023 SEASON.</p>

# The vi7eti Story

[HL7 Europe](https://hl7europe.org) participates with partners in European [Interoperability Projects](https://hl7europe.org/projects-initiatives/). One outcome of this kind of projects are Interoperability Specifications such as [FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/) (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) [Implementation Guides](https://hl7europe.org/standards/#igs) (IG). An IG typically contains example instances in the technical exchange / data format FHIR.

Rendering the content of such example instances is subject to this **vi7eti** (Visualize HL7 Example and Test Instances) endeavor of HL7 Europe. Its primary goal is to act as a reference installation for various types of artifacts found in the following specifications:

- Electronic Medicinal Product Information (ePI) based on the Electronic Medicinal Product Information (ePI) [FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/emedicinal-product-info/)
- HL7 Europe Laboratory Report (EU-Lab) based on the HL7 Europe Laboratory Report [FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/laboratory/)
- International Patient Summary (IPS) based on the International Patient Summary [FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/)
- HL7 Europe Hospital Discharge Letter (HDR) based on the Hospital Discharge Letter (HDR) FHIR Implementation Guide
- ... more to come

In some of these projects, also Synthetic Realistic Example and Test Data plays a role. There is another HL7 Europe activity called **SYNDERAI** (Synthetic Data: Examples – Realistic – using AI, see [here](https://github.com/hl7-eu/SYNDERAI) on GitHub) where test and Example Instances are generated. Please see the GitHub repository for  more information.
